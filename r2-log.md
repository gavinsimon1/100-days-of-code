### Day 2: June 10. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Recreating the Conquer template using Bootstrap https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer.  Set up the navbar and jumbotron.

**Thoughts:**
I'm still getting used to using bootstrap.  Need to figure out how to center the menu.  But I'm making progress.
